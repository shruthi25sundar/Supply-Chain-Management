Based on the provided context, the supplier's risks are high due to compliance issues and potential supply chain disruption. Therefore, it's important to consider the following:

**1. Payment and Delivery Terms:**

* Negotiate for a shorter payment term (30 days) and stricter delivery schedule (5 days) to mitigate supply chain disruption risks.
* Include penalty clauses for late deliveries as a financial consequence.

**2. Compliance Monitoring:**

* Establish a formal process for monitoring supplier compliance with relevant standards.
* Define clear consequences for non-compliance and outline steps for remediation.

**3. Alternative Suppliers:**

* Identify and assess potential alternative suppliers as a backup plan.
* This ensures you have options in case the current supplier fails to meet expectations.

**4. Cost Comparison:**

* While cost is important, prioritize risk mitigation and compliance.
* Consider the long-term costs associated with supplier selection, not just the per-unit price.

**5. Communication and Collaboration:**

* Maintain open communication and collaboration with the supplier to find mutually beneficial solutions.
* Be willing to work together to address any concerns or challenges.

"**Impact of the 60-day payment term on cash flow:**

**1. Reduced Cash Availability:**

- A 60-day payment term effectively increases the time period between making payments to suppliers and receiving payment from customers.
- With a 60-day payment term, the company will have to wait an additional month compared to a 30-day payment term to receive payment from customers for goods or services purchased.


**2. Potential Cash Flow Delays:**

- The extended payment period can lead to temporary cash flow shortages if the company's accounts receivable cycle is shorter than 60 days.
- Suppliers may request payment in advance or impose interest charges on outstanding balances.

**3. Increased Inventory Costs:**

- A longer payment term could result in the company holding inventory for longer, incurring storage and financing costs.
- The increased inventory levels can affect cash flow if the company has limited storage space or financing options.

**4. Supplier Selection and Negotiation:**

- The 60-day payment term may limit the pool of potential suppliers willing to offer such a long payment term.
